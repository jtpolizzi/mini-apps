# Vocab Mini-App Notes (v2.11.1)

## Snapshot
- SPA written in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; routes driven via hash (`#/list`, `#/cards`, `#/match`, `#/choice`).
- Vocabulary loaded from `data/words.tsv` (preferred) or `data/words.json`, then normalized through `mapRaw()` into `State.words`.
- Global `State` persists filters, stars, weights, and UI prefs in `localStorage`; `subscribe()` notifies mounted views.
- Components live in `assets/components/` and mount/unmount via `mount*` helpers; shared top bar + settings modal stay resident.

## Current Views
### Word List
- Sortable table with sticky header and columns for ⭐, weight, Spanish, English, POS, CEFR, Tags.
- Filter/search chips in the shared top bar (Only★, Shuffle, Filters popover, Search, Settings).
- Filters offer multi-select for POS/CEFR/Tags/Weights plus quick clear; result count shown live.

### Flashcards
- Large center card plus persistent bottom nav (← counter →) with keyboard + touch parity.
- Click/tap center to flip; left/right tap zones or horizontal swipes move prev/next.
- Keyboard: ←/→ prev/next, Space/Enter/↑/↓ flip, `s` toggles star, digits `0`-`4` set weight.
- Top-right overlays expose ⭐ toggle, weight chips, and optional translation line tied to settings.

### Match & Multiple Choice
- Word Match pairs Spanish ↔ English tiles with progress tracking.
- Multiple Choice generates lightweight quizzes pulling from the filtered word pool.

## Data & Persistence
- `State` fields: `words`, `filters`, `order` (shuffle), `ui` prefs, plus derived helpers in `state.js`.
- User progress lives under the `Prog` namespace (stars + weights) and syncs across all views.
- Filters and shuffle order survive reloads; resetting happens via Settings → “Reset filters & order”.

## Recent Additions (v2.5 → v2.9)
1. Unified top bar + settings modal shared by every view.
2. Flashcard refinements: guarded controls, translation toggle, improved touch targets, keyboard helpers.
3. New learning modes (Match, Multiple Choice) alongside the list/cards staples.
4. TSV-first loading pipeline with JSON fallback plus better tag formatting.

## v2.10 Highlights
1. Word List tap-to-select: every pointer interaction on a row (including weight/star controls) now syncs the current word selection so other views stay in lockstep.
2. Shuffle/sort state hygiene: pointer suppression + focus restoration tweaks keep keyboard navigation sharp after sorting or randomizing.
3. Styling polish: refreshed accent tokens, spark icon usage, and darker chips for better contrast on the list/filters.

## v2.11.x Refinements
1. Word List layout overhaul so the entire top stack (header + filters + table head) stays fixed while only the rows scroll; shuffle order respected via dedicated scroll container.
2. Tightened spacing between the top bar, column headers, and list rows to match the Match/Choice views; table rows now slide neatly under the sticky header without “jumping”.
3. Flashcards regained their full-width sizing inside the new layout (`width: min(100%, 720px)`), preventing narrow cards when the body switches flex modes.
4. Body scroll locking now activates only while the list view is mounted, so Flashcards, Word Match, and Multiple Choice retain their original column/flow layouts.

## Next Targets / Ideas
1. Progress export/import (JSON) for stars + weights.
2. Optional TTS button + auto-speak toggle on flashcards.
3. Enhanced filter UX (clear-all, select-all weights) and Edge sticky-header workaround.
4. Hosting story (GitHub Pages) and/or packaging as a simple PWA.
