# These are notes for Codex

## Purpose of this doc

This doc is for Codex to read at the beginning of every session - for guidelines of how I want to work with it.

## App Background

* This is a single developer / single user app. I am the only developer and the only user. It is only deployed on MY devices.

## Rules

* Assume that I want to DISCUSS things with you before you just go off an start coding. I like to be part of the planning, design, etc.
* If I ask you to do a commit - reference the current version number that the commit relates to - like: 2.12.4 - changes related to....
* If we make a lot of changes - and it seems like we are done with them, ask if we should increment the version number.  If I says yes
  * Modify the version number of the app
  * Add notes to NOTES.md of what was included in the version that we were working on

## Background info that YOU SHOULD READ (under docs)
