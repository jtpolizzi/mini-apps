# Architecture & Modernization Plan

## 1. Cleanup Status (v2.12.x)
- ✅ **Phase 1 (v2.12.2)** – Removed the legacy weight-migration helper and switched all `localStorage` keys to the `lv:` prefix while purging the old `v23:` entries.
- ✅ **Phase 2 (v2.12.3)** – Added canonical `termKey`s (word + POS) so overlapping data files share stars/weights; components now use `termKey` for persistence.
- ✅ **Phase 3 (v2.12.4)** – Completed the architectural/code review with shared state actions, event-driven components, common chip/popover helpers, loader events + debug panel, and a Vitest + happy-dom test harness.
- ✅ Repo restructure (v2.13.0) – `language-vocab` now lives at the repo root; Vite/TS build + Pages workflow deploy the app directly from `dist/`.

### Phase 3 Review Notes (working doc) (✅ Completed)
**State & persistence**

- `assets/state.js` now splits into `state/persistence.js`, `state/store.js`, and `state/selectors.js`. Store actions (`setFilters`, `setSort`, etc.) fan out through explicit events (`State.on('filtersChanged', …)`), so views update only when relevant data changes. Loader metadata (`State.meta.loaderStatus`) flows alongside hydrate events.

**Component boundaries**
- Every view mount returns `{ destroy }`, and `app.js` routes through a registry. Shared chip/popover helpers live under `components/ui/`, so TopBar, WordMatch, Choice, and Settings all consume the same DOM primitives. Word List still mixes rendering + gestures (future work when we move to TS/typed presenters).

**Effects & async work**
- TSV loading runs through `assets/data/loader.js`, emitting `loading/loaded/error` events. `app.js` shows a loading indicator/debug panel until data arrives, and the panel is toggleable in Settings. Long-lived components clean up timers/listeners inside their returned `destroy` handlers.

**Testing & instrumentation**
- A Vitest + happy-dom harness (`npm test`) covers state data mapping, selectors, loader events, and UI helpers. The debug overlay (opt-in via Settings) surfaces loader status and event counts for manual verification. Future TS work will expand coverage to typed modules/components.

## 2. Near-Term Modernization

### Step A – TypeScript + ES Modules (v2.13.x ✅)
1. Introduce a lightweight build (Vite + TypeScript) that outputs the same static assets for GitHub Pages.
2. Define types for `VocabEntry`, `TermKey`, `State`, `Prog`, etc., and convert existing JS files incrementally (`state.ts`, `components/*.ts`, utilities).
3. Keep the current DOM-driven UI while benefiting from type safety and clearer module boundaries.

**Status**
- Tooling + repo structure are settled (`npm run dev`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`).
- All components have strict typings and Vitest coverage; ESLint/Prettier keep formatting consistent and the GH Pages workflow deploys `dist/` automatically.

Step A is complete; proceed to Step B work below.

### Step B – Svelte Evaluation (target v2.14.x, in progress)
1. Rebuild a single view (Word List) in Svelte using the typed stores to gauge ergonomics, bundle size, and complexity.
2. Document findings (pros/cons vs. vanilla) to decide whether a full migration is worthwhile.

**Status (v2.14.1)** – Svelte + plugin are wired into Vite, a dedicated `#/svelte-list` route shares the existing state through a bridge store, and the Word List UI is now fully mirrored in Svelte (sorting, star/weight controls, long-press selection, shuffle order, styling parity). Both routes remain live so the legacy list can serve as a comparison point while we capture DX/perf notes and decide how to migrate the remaining views.

### Step C – Conditional Svelte Migration (post-evaluation)
1. If Svelte proves valuable, plan a phased component migration (TopBar, WordList, Flashcards, Match, Choice, Settings).
2. Establish shared stores for global state, Drive/OPFS integration hooks, and PWA plumbing.
3. Ensure the build still emits static files for GitHub Pages (SvelteKit static adapter or Vite build).

## 3. Cross-Cutting Cleanup Items
- ✅ Complete the Phase 3 review with concrete recommendations (state organization, event handling, shared utilities, testing strategy).
- ✅ Consolidate naming (language-neutral field names, consistent module paths).
- Add linting/formatting + broader automated tests once the TS build is in place.

## 4. Version Milestones
- **v2.12.4+** – Publish the code-review findings and finalize Phase 3.
- **v2.13.x** – Land TypeScript + module build (Step A, in progress).
- **v2.14.x** – Prototype a Svelte view and decide on full migration (Step B).
- **v2.15.x+** – Execute the migration plan if approved (Step C), or extend the vanilla codebase with the review recommendations if not.
